## Flutter Android Bridge

Flutter Android Bridge is a Flutter package that provides a bridge to interact with Android's native functionalities. This package allows Flutter applications to communicate with Android's package manager, intents, and other native features through a simple and intuitive API.

### Features

- Interact with Android's package manager (`pm`) to list, install, and uninstall packages.
- Interact with Android's activity manager (`am`).
- Launch Android intents for various actions such as opening URLs, sending emails, and more.
- Access and manage Android's native functionalities seamlessly from your Flutter app.

### Installation

Add the following to your pubspec.yaml file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_android_bridge: ^0.0.1
```

Then run `flutter pub get` to install the package.

### Usage

```dart
import 'package:flutter_android_bridge/flutter_android_bridge.dart';

void main() {
    final adb = FlutterAndroidBridge();
    final client = adb.newClient('192.168.1.1:5555');

    await client.connect();

    final packageManager = adb.pm();
    // Example: List installed packages
    packageManager.listPackages().then((packages) {
        packages.forEach((package) {
        print('Package: ${package.name}');
        });
    });
